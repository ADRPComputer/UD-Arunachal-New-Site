                <h2>Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana - National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM)</h2>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana-National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM)
                    was launched in September 2013.It aims at creating sustainable livelihoods opportunities for the
                    Urban Poor in Urban areas through multi-pronged approach. The coverage of the Mission has been
                    extended to all 33 (thirty-three) statutory towns in Arunachal Pradesh. DAY-NULM aims at offering
                    avenues for Self-Employment and Wage -employment to the Urban poor by way of Skill training and
                    provision of bank loan on subsidized rate of interest. It focuses on mainstreaming the roles of
                    community, community organizations and institutions of the poor to promote livelihoods
                    opportunities. It also provides financial support for construction, operation & maintenance of
                    shelter for the Urban Homeless. In addition, it addresses the livelihoods concerns of Urban street
                    vendors.</p>

        <div class="row mt-4">
            <div class="col">
                <h5>Mission Objective</h5>
                <hr class="mt-1">
                <p style="text-align: justify;">To reduce poverty and vulnerability of the urban poor households by
                    enabling them to access gainful self-employment and skilled wage employment opportunities, resulting
                    in an appreciable improvement in their livelihoods on a sustainable basis, through building strong
                    grassroots level institutions of the poor. The mission would aim at providing shelter equipped with
                    essential services to the urban homeless in a phased manner. In addition, the Mission would also
                    address livelihood concerns of the urban street vendors by facilitating access to suitable spaces,
                    institutional credit, social security and skills to the urban street vendors for accessing emerging
                    market opportunities.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row mt-4">
            <div class="col">
                <h5>Guiding Principle</h5>
                <hr class="mt-1">
                <p style="text-align: justify;">The core belief of Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana-National Urban Livelihoods
                    Mission (DAY-NULM) is that the poor are entrepreneurial and have innate desire to come out of
                    poverty. The challenge is to unleash their capabilities to generate meaningful and sustainable
                    livelihoods. The first step in this process is motivating the urban poor to form their own
                    institutions. They and their institutions need to be provided sufficient capacity so that they can
                    manage the external environment, access finance, expand their skills, enterprises and assets. This
                    requires continuous and carefully designed handholding support. An external, dedicated and sensitive
                    support structure, from the national level to the city and community levels, is required to induce
                    social mobilizations, institution building and livelihood promotion.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">DAY-NULM believes that any livelihood promotion Programme can be scaled
                    up in a timebound manner only if driven by the poor and their institutions. Such strong
                    institutional platforms support the poor in building up their own human, social, financial, and
                    other assets. This in turn, enables them access to rights, entitlements, opportunities and services
                    from the public and private sectors, while enhancing their solidarity, voice and bargaining power.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">As per the Constitution (74thAmendment) Act, 1992, urban poverty
                    alleviation is a legitimate function of the Urban Local Bodies (ULB). Therefore, ULBs would need to
                    undertake a lead role for all issues and programmes concerning the urban poor in cities/towns,
                    including skills and livelihoods.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">DAY-NULM would aim at universal coverage of the urban poor for skill
                    development and credit facilities. It will strive for skills training of the urban poor for
                    market-based jobs and self-employment, facilitating easy access to credit.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Street vendors constitute an important segment of the urban population
                    at the bottom of the pyramid. Street vending provides a source of self-employment, and thus acts as
                    a measure of urban poverty alleviation without major Government intervention. They have a prominent
                    place in the urban supply chain and are an integral part of the economic growth process within urban
                    areas. NULM would aim at facilitating access to suitable spaces, institutional credit, social
                    security and skills to the urban street vendors for accessing emerging market opportunities.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Urban homeless persons who live without shelter or social security/
                    protection are the most vulnerable class, even while they contribute towards sustaining cities with
                    their cheap labour. Life on the streets involves surviving continuously at the edge, in a physically
                    brutalized and challenging environment. There is a need for appropriate policy intervention to
                    address the challenges faced by homeless people, with regard to shelter, social housing and social
                    protection. Accordingly, NULM would aim at providing shelter equipped with essential services to the
                    urban homeless in a phased manner.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">DAY-NULM would place a very high emphasis on convergence with
                    schemes/programmes of the relevant line Ministries/Departments and programmes of state governments
                    dealing with skills, livelihoods, entrepreneurship development, health, education, social
                    assistance, etc. An alliance strategy will be sought with all concerned departments to promote
                    skills training of rural-urban migrants as a bridge between the livelihoods of the rural and urban
                    poor.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">DAY-NULM would aim at partnership with the private sector in providing
                    skill training, employment and operation of shelter for homeless. It will strive for active
                    participation of private and civil society sectors in providing shelter to the urban homeless, skill
                    training and placement of the urban poor and also in facilitating technological, marketing and
                    handholding support for the urban poor entrepreneurs who want to be self-employed and set up their
                    own small businesses or manufacturing units.</p>

                <hr class="mt-1">
                <p style="text-align: justify;">DAY-NULM is adopting the following strategy :</p>
                <ul>
                    <li style="text-align: justify;">Building capacity of the urban poor, their institutions and the
                        machinery involved in the implementation of livelihoods development and poverty alleviation
                        programmes through handholding support.</li>
                    <li style="text-align: justify;">Enhancing and expanding existing livelihoods options of the urban
                        poor.</li>
                    <li style="text-align: justify;">Building skills to enable access to growing market-based job
                        opportunities offered by emerging urban economies.</li>
                    <li style="text-align: justify;">Training for and support to the establishment of micro-enterprises
                        by the urban poor – self and group.</li>
                    <li style="text-align: justify;">Ensure availability and access for the urban homeless population to
                        permanent 24- hour shelters including the basic infrastructural facilities like water supply,
                        sanitation, safety and security.</li>
                    <li style="text-align: justify;">Cater to the needs of especially vulnerable segments of the urban
                        homeless like the dependent children, aged, disabled, mentally ill, and recovering patients
                        etc., by creating special sections within homeless shelters and provisioning special service
                        linkages for them.</li>
                    <li style="text-align: justify;">To establish strong rights-based linkages with other programmes
                        which cover the right of the urban homeless to food, healthcare, education, etc. and ensure
                        access for homeless populations to various entitlements, including to social security pensions,

                <h5>DAY-NULM Mission Cities and Target Population</h5>
                <hr class="mt-1">
                <p style="text-align: justify;">DAY-NULM are being implemented in all District Headquarter Towns and all
                    other cities with a population of 100,000 or more as per 2011 Census. However, other towns may be
                    allowed in exceptional cases on request of the States.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">The primary target of NULM is the urban poor, including the urban
                    homeless. The Socioeconomic and Caste Census (SECC), 2011 for identification of urban poor is
                    currently under progress. Accordingly, as an interim measure, the target of NULM will be the urban
                    population identified presently as below poverty line population in urban areas by the States/UTs.
                    The coverage may be broadened to include families of disadvantaged groups like SCs, STs, women,
                    minorities, disabled etc. subject to a maximum of 25 percent of the above urban poor population.</p>
